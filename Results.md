The graph 12-17 shows an increase usage (no more than 20%). The graph of 18-25
has the highest percentage usage of marijuana (approximately 50%). The graph 
of 26+ does show signs of increase use especially in legalized states. 
Although legalization does not mean that there will be increased usage of marijuana, 
the results show that trends are subjected to changes dependong 
on how avaliable the drug is. Interestingly, Washington legalized in 2012 and the 
percent of usage has fluctuated within the age range of 12-17.
